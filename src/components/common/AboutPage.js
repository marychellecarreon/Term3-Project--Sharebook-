      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Share Book uses the power of giving to change the world. We collect books online
         to donate books and fund literacy initiatives in the Philippines.
         We were founded in 2017 by three students (Jessie/Dea/Chelle) from the Vivixx Academy Bootcamp who started
         this as a project and ended up forming a pioneering social charity with a mission
         to promote literacy.
         </p>

      <p>Every book donated from us contributes to individual literacy throughout the Philippines
         and the potential for a better life.
      </p>

      <p>Let us support this mission to create a better children of the next generation! </p>
